              <p>This document governs the terms under which you may access and use the application programming interface that is made available on this website (the &#8220;<b>API</b>&#8221;), and the data transmitted through the API (the &#8220;<b><?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  Content</b>&#8221;).  This document incorporates the terms of the following additional documents, including all future amendments or modifications thereto (collectively, and together with this document, the &#8220;<b>API Agreement</b>&#8221;):</p> 
              <ul> 
              <li><a href="/api-branding-requirements.html"><?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  Branding Requirements</a></li> 
              <li><a href="/api-terms-of-use.html"><?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  Terms of Service</a></li> 
              <li><a href="/privacy.html"><?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  Privacy Policy</a></li> 
              </ul> 
              <p>By accessing or using the API or <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  Content, you agree to be bound by the API Agreement.  If you access or use the API or <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  Content on behalf of a company, principal or other entity, you represent that you have authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to the API Agreement and that it is fully binding upon them.  In such case, the term &#8220;you&#8221; will refer to such entity and its affiliates.  If you do not have authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of the API Agreement, you may not access or use the API or <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  Content.  You should read and keep a copy of each component of the API Agreement for your records.  In the event of a conflict among them, the terms of this document will control.</p> 
            
              <p><b>1. <u>Purpose</u></b> </p> 
              <p>The API is made available by <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  , Inc. <b><?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  </b>&quot;) to enable others to access valuable local information and present it to their end users in new and imaginative ways that are more complementary than competitive in nature to <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  &#8217;s own services.  With this in mind, <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  reserves the right to continually review and evaluate all uses of the API.</p> 
            
              <p><b>2. <u>Changes</u></b> </p> 
              <p><?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  reserves the right to modify or revise the API Agreement at any time.  You should visit this website periodically to review the documents comprising the API Agreement and check for updates.  Your continued use of the API after the effective date of any such changes will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to such changes.  <b>If YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND TO ANY NEW TERMS, YOU MUST TERMINATE THE API AGREEMENT BY IMMEDIATELY CEASING USE OF THE API.</b></p> 
            
              <p><b>3. <u>Registration</u></b> </p>
