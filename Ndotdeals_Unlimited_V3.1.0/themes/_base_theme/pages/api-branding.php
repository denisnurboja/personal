                  <p>We want you to use our content in useful and interesting ways, not boring or underhanded ways. To that end, we have some rules in addition to those explained in the <a href="/api-terms-of-use.html">API Terms of Use</a>:</p>
            
                  <div class="fl clr">

                      <h3>Give Us Credit</h3>
            
                      <p>Wherever you display our content, you must prominently display our logo (see below). It should be obvious that the information originates from <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  . Also, don’t claim responsibility or sponsorship for <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  content (e.g., <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  ’s deal of the day is brought to you by Larry’s Crab Shack).</p>
            
                      <h3>Live in the Moment</h3>

            
                      <p>The API is for real time user-driven requests. Don’t capture information from the API for later use.</p>
            
                      <h3>Keep it Consumer Facing</h3>
            
                      <p>Don’t use <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  information for non-consumer purposes.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="fr">
                      <h3>Add Value</h3>
            
                      <p>If you’re only going to recreate the functionality of <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  ’s own website or mobile apps, save yourself the trouble and just put up a link.</p>

            
                      <h3>Enable Links</h3>
            
                      <p>Don’t ‘nofollow’ your links to <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  .</p>
            
                      <h3>Give Us the Spotlight</h3>
            
                      <p>Don’t aggregate our deals with other providers.</p>
            
                      <h3>Leave Our Content Alone</h3>
            
                      <p>Don’t alter our logo, graphics, or copy provided by <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  .</p>

                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <h2>For Mobile</h2>
            
                  <p>Have clear <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  branding at the top of app/mobile pages where you’re using and/or incorporating <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  content. On platforms where <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  also has a mobile application, we may require you to link directly to our application instead of our mobile site.</p>
                  
                  <h3>Usage</h3>
            
                  <p>The mark must appear at a minimum height of 15px, and clearing space guidelines must be followed. The mark cannot be modified, seperated or cut apart in any way.</p>

            
                  <p>The mark must also always link back to <b><?php echo SITE_NAME; ?>  </b></p>

                </div>
